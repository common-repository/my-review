My Review plugin helps you format your post as a review.

My Review plugin helps you format your post as a review by making it easier for your readers to spot the good and the bad of the product/service you're reviewing. You can also rate different aspects(price, quality, taste - you name it) of it according to your liking.
You can customize the formatting by modifying the template found in the plugin's directory.
